    <p><strong>Computational power:</strong> Training LLMs demands incredible computational resources, like high-performance GPUs and specialised AI hardware. Access to these resources and the ability to optimise training processes are crucial.</p>

    <p><strong>Model architecture:</strong> Designing the LLM’s architecture involves complex decisions about parameters, layers, and attention mechanisms. Optimising this architecture for performance and efficiency is critical.</p>

    <p><strong>Evaluation and bias:</strong> Evaluating the performance of LLMs involves diverse benchmarks and careful monitoring for biases and harmful outputs. Mitigating these biases is an ongoing research challenge.</p>

    <p><strong>Resource and expertise:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Team effort:</strong> Developing an LLM like ChatGPT 4 or Google Gemini requires a large team of experts across various disciplines, including AI researchers, machine learning engineers, data scientists, and software developers.</p>

    <p><strong>Financial investment:</strong> The financial resources needed are substantial, covering costs for data acquisition, hardware, software, and talent. Access to sustained funding is critical.</p>

    <p>Additionally:</p>

    <p><strong>Ethical considerations:</strong> LLMs raise ethical concerns like potential misuse, misinformation, and societal impacts. Responsible development and deployment are crucial.</p>

    <p><strong>Rapidly evolving field:</strong> The LLM landscape is constantly evolving, with new research, models, and benchmarks emerging. Staying abreast of these advancements is essential.</p>

    <p>Therefore, while ChatGPT 4 and Google Gemini have made impressive strides, developing similar LLMs remains a daunting task accessible only to a handful of organizations with the necessary resources and expertise.</p>

    <p>In simpler terms, it’s like building a skyscraper of knowledge and intelligence. You need the right materials (data), the right tools (hardware and software), the right architects (experts), and a lot of hard work and attention to detail to make it stand tall and function flawlessly.</p>

    <p>Developing similar models would be a daunting task for individual developers or smaller teams due to the enormous scale of resources and expertise needed. However, as technology progresses and research findings become more accessible, it might become incrementally more feasible for a broader range of organizations or researchers to work on similar models, albeit at a smaller scale or with fewer resources. At that time we might also start to focus on developing LLMs ourselves.</p>

    <p>To sum up, the focus of the program is not on LLM model development but on applied Cloud GenAI Engineering (GenEng), application development, and fine-tuning of foundational models. The program covers a wide range of topics including Python, GenAI, Microserices, API, Database, Cloud Development, and DevOps, which will give students a comprehensive understanding of generative AI and prepare them for careers in this field.</p>

    <p><strong>Control:</strong> You have full control over the training data, algorithms, and biases, ensuring alignment with your ethical and business values.</p>

    <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>High cost:</strong> Building and training LLMs require significant technical expertise, computational resources, and data, translating to high financial investment.</p>

    <p><strong>Time commitment:</strong> Developing an LLM is a time-consuming process, potentially delaying your go-to-market with your application.</p>

    <p><strong>Technical expertise:</strong> You need a team of highly skilled AI specialists to design, train, and maintain the LLM.</p>

    <p><strong>Using existing LLMs:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Pros:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Lower cost:</strong> Leveraging existing LLMs through APIs or fine-tuning is significantly cheaper than building them from scratch.</p>

    <p><strong>Faster time to market:</strong> You can quickly integrate existing LLMs into your applications, accelerating your launch timeline.</p>

    <p><strong>Reduced technical burden:</strong> You don’t need a large team of AI specialists to maintain the LLM itself</p>

    <p><strong>Cons:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>Less customization:</strong> Existing LLMs are not specifically designed for your needs, potentially leading to lower performance on some tasks.</p>

    <p><strong>Limited control:</strong> You rely on the data and biases of the existing LLM, which might not align with your specific requirements.</p>

    <p><strong>Dependency on external parties:</strong> You are dependent on the availability and maintenance of the LLM by its developers.</p>

    <p><strong>Here are some additional factors to consider:</strong></p>

    <p><strong>The complexity of your application:</strong> Simpler applications might benefit more from existing LLMs, while highly complex ones might require the customization of a dedicated LLM.</p>

    <p><strong>Your available resources:</strong> If you have the financial and technical resources, developing your own LLM might be feasible. Otherwise, existing options might be more practical.</p>

    <p><strong>Your competitive landscape:</strong> If your competitors are using LLMs, you might need to follow suit to remain competitive.</p>

    <p>Ultimately, the best decision depends on your specific needs, resources, and business goals. Carefully evaluating the pros and cons of each approach will help you choose the strategy that best aligns with your success.</p>

    <p><strong>What are Custom GPTs?</strong></p>

    <p>“Custom GPTs” refers to specialised versions of the Generative Pre-trained</p>

    <p>Transformer (GPT) models that are tailored for specific tasks, industries, or data types. These custom models are adapted from the base GPT architecture, which is a type of language model developed by OpenAI. Custom GPT models are trained or fine-tuned on specific datasets or for particular applications, allowing them to perform better in those contexts compared to the general-purpose models.</p>

    <p>Here are some examples of what custom GPT models might be used for:</p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Industry-Specific Needs</strong>: A custom GPT for legal, medical, or financial industries could be trained on domain-specific texts to understand and generate industry-specific language more accurately.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Language and Localization</strong>: Models can be customised for different languages or dialects that might not be well-represented in the training data of the base model.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Company-Specific Applications</strong>: Organisations might develop a custom GPT model trained on their own documents and communications to assist with internal tasks like drafting emails, generating reports, or providing customer support.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Educational Purposes</strong>: Educational institutions might develop custom GPTs trained on educational material to assist in creating teaching materials or providing tutoring in specific subjects.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Creative Writing and Entertainment</strong>: Custom models could be trained on specific genres of literature or scripts to assist in creative writing or content creation.</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p><strong>Technical and Scientific Research</strong>: A custom GPT model could be trained on scientific literature to assist researchers in summarising papers, generating hypotheses, or even drafting new research.</p>
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>These custom models are created through a process of fine-tuning, where the base GPT model is further trained (or ‘fine-tuned’) on a specific dataset. This process allows the model to become more adept at understanding and generating text that is relevant to the specific use case. Fine-tuning requires expertise in machine learning and natural language processing, as well as access to relevant training data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What are Actions in GPTs?</strong></p>

    <p>Actions are a way to connect custom GPTs to external APIs, allowing them to access data or interact with the real-world. For example, you can use actions to create a GPT that can book flights, send emails, or order pizza. <strong>Actions are defined using the OpenAPI specification</strong>, which is a standard for describing APIs. You can import an existing OpenAPI specification or create a new one using the GPT editor.</p>
